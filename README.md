# Certifi.em

A blockchain-based application which will automatically generate certificates as well as validates them. The data will be authenticated, reliable and unchangeable. It offers ease of determining whether a document is authentic or not and also checking the integrity and originality with the help of distributed technologies like IPFS and Ethereum smart contracts.

# Design Details

With the use of distributed technologies like IPFS and
Ethereum smart contracts, our system makes it
simple to determine whether a document is real and to
validate its integrity and originality. The participants
which interact with our smart contract are as follows:

a) College: The College serves as the issuing authority for
certificates. Any organisation that wants to issue a
certificate can be this entity. Only one or more
certifications can be issued by a college or certificate
issuing body in the system. It will also contain a phase
during which the College will issue certificates after
validating and authorising the information.

b) Student: Digital documents will be available for
students to download and read. Students also obtain 
the ID of the document that was provided to them, which
may be utilised in the future.

c) Company: With the use of the document's ID, the company will be the user who has access to information about the document's originality, validity, and integrity.

# Result


In the initial screen, the user has the opportunity to
produce or validate certificates by browsing via the
navigation bar.

The issuer of the certificate will be prompted to fill up
their certificate form first. The issuer will be prompted to
fill in the data of the various fields based on the number of
fields. That data will be grabbed by our system and
appended to the pre-inserted template.

For the Document, a preview will be created. IPFS will
conduct its hashing process and save it if the issuer
accepts it. The same hash will be sent to the Blockchain
Node, where the issuer must accept the Document

Blockchain.

The user may then upload it and have it forwarded to their relevant email address, along with the certificate ID and a link to preview the certificate.

Now follows the verification section, where the verifier
may check the legitimacy of a candidate's certificate by
entering the certificate Id given by the issuer.

If an issuer gives a fake Certificate Id, the system will
show that no other certificate with the same Id exists.

After verification, the verifier can look at the certificate to double-check the candidate's information and certify his
or her qualifications.
